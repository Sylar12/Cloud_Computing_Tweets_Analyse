Hi,

For Q6, use q6_map.jar and q6_reduce.jar to do MapReduce.

Use q6_0.jar to add 0 for user_id, then sort.

Use q6_sum.jar to calculate the total amount of photos.

Use q6_sum0.jar to stagger 1 position between user_id and photo_amount. (to make the data more easily for my teammates to use)

Thanks.
